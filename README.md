# __OPEN-SOURCE__  *HIP HOP* 
## A Guide To Making Hip Hop In An Age Of CORPORATE GREED
### INTRO
Peace & blessings to all! My name is Samy Esseghir and I'm a member of the [Noutéka collective and label](nouteka.co "Nouéteka.co"). Through [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EAiDXOAEasAq5u4bwnayr?si=aUJmWL1aRJSQJAo4xv7OUA&nd=1 "Noutéka Spotify page"), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrz7iesfdM-ZfXhDm_gNZ5w "Noutéka YouTube page"), and other streaming platforms, we've been putting out independent music since 2018 and taking many risks by not clearing our samples simply because of a lack of funds.

The art of sampling can be challenging enough and if you intend to share the work with the public, some streaming platforms may block your content quicker than it can be uploaded. The reason for this is copyright laws, which have also led to the decline of Hip Hop, R&B, and House music styles that many of us love.

**THIS MUST STOP!!!**

### _HOW TO KEEP IT REAL IN 2021_
Buying Drum-machines, Samplers or DAWs(Digital Audio Workstation) can be quite expensive and at times elitist but after having researched open-source software and the many options available for the creation of sample-based music in general, the illusion of corporate monopoly over art is beautifully fading away and the doors of creativity and originality are being pushed wide open.

So let's keep it real! 
Illegally downloading DAWs is A-okay in my book but samples are a different ball game. In terms of creativity, there isn't a limit to what you can sample but it's how you use that sample that determines the impact it has on one's audience. Ripping an entire song and adding drums on top isn't cool nor is it a song, It's a remix and nobody needs a drum and bass version of singing in the rain unless you're walking through the gates of hell.
Music sampling is luckily considered an art form and as of 2020, the Library of Congress created an open-source website called [DJ CITIZEN](https://citizen-dj.labs.loc.gov/) where every and anyone is welcome to download and sample music and videos without restriction. They even have a music production app on the site that enables you to make beats online and some of the music and videos are over 100 years old, excluding them from copyright laws.

If you happen to own __Akai MPC__![Akai Mpc](https://www.thempcbox.com/wp-content/sampler/3000/3000.png)or a copy of __Ableton live__ ![Ableton Live](https://ableton-production.imgix.net/og-images/live.png?w=1200&fm=jpg)on your computer, then this is all you need baby Paul!!!

But if you can't afford it, maybe you just wanna try making beats for the first time or don't want to risk illegally downloading software, that's cool because I've compiled a list of open-source music software for everything needed to get _FONKY_!

Using DJ Citizen in conjunction with any of the software I've shown in the list above will result in extremely _PHAT BEATZ_ if used the right way and that right way is for you to discover through the magic of music-making.

## Will They Reminisce Over You
Many artists that have been sampled have found a resurgence in popularity from a younger audience that probably would not have heard of them otherwise.

Music sampling breathes new life into old music and brings appreciation to those who had not felt appreciated before, whether alive or dead.

As [Stetsasonic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqq9GGONSxY "Stetsasonic - Talkin' All That Jazz Youtube Video" ) famously put it 

> _TELL THE TRUTH, JAMES BROWN WAS OLD, TIL ERIC & RA CAME OUT WITH "I GOT SOUL"_

__SO ON THAT NOTE, I WISH YOU ALL A GREAT TIME DIGGING IN THESE LEGAL CRATES :)__
